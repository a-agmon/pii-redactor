2. Smaller Model Recommendations

  Here are smaller multilingual models you can try:

  Tiny Models (<100MB)

  1. microsoft/xtremedistil-l6-h256-uncased (22M params, ~85MB)
    - 6 layers, 256 hidden dimensions
    - 6x smaller than DistilBERT
    - Supports 100+ languages
  2. google/electra-small-discriminator (14M params, ~55MB)
    - Very efficient architecture
    - Good for token classification
    - Multilingual version available
  3. albert-base-v2 (12M params, ~48MB)
    - Parameter sharing makes it tiny
    - Good performance despite size
    - Has multilingual variants

  Small Models (100-300MB)

  4. microsoft/mdeberta-v3-base (86M params, ~340MB)
    - Better than DistilBERT for many tasks
    - Excellent multilingual support
    - More efficient architecture
  5. xlm-roberta-base pruned versions
    - Various pruned versions available (30-50% smaller)
    - Maintains good multilingual performance

  3. Are Smaller Models Faster?

  Generally YES, but with caveats:

  Speed Benefits:

  - Faster inference: Less computation needed
  - Lower memory bandwidth: Less data to move
  - Better CPU performance: Fit in cache better
  - Faster loading: Smaller files to read

  Performance Trade-offs:

  | Model Size         | Speed                       | Accuracy          | Best For                          |
  |--------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
  | Tiny (<100MB)      | Very Fast (200+ texts/sec)  | Lower (85-90% F1) | High-volume, tolerance for errors |
  | Small (100-300MB)  | Fast (100-150 texts/sec)    | Good (90-95% F1)  | Balanced performance              |
  | Medium (300-500MB) | Moderate (50-100 texts/sec) | High (95%+ F1)    | Quality-critical                  |

⏺ Recommendation for Your Use Case

  For PII redaction with Hebrew support, I'd suggest trying:

  1. microsoft/xtremedistil-l6-h256-uncased
    - 6x smaller than current model
    - Should give 3-5x speed improvement
    - May need more training epochs due to smaller capacity

  To switch models:
  # config.yaml
  model:
    base_model: "microsoft/xtremedistil-l6-h256-uncased"
    max_length: 128
    label_all_tokens: false

  Then:
  python cleanup.py --all
  python main.py

  The smaller model will likely need more training data or epochs to reach similar accuracy, but will be much faster for inference.
